# Introduction

This specification defines the Event Modeling Language ("EML"). The principle objective of EML is to provide a ubiqutous language for describing large event driven solutions making it easier for analyts, architects, and developers to work and collaborate together.

By adopting a common language, and through the support of relevant tooling, modelers will have the capability to fully describe and discover events not only within their own jurisdiction, but those that are also external to it. A common language will make event driven applications and services easier to design, deploy, and evolve.

## Scope

The EML is designed to be a highly visual language and this _superstructure_ specification aims to describe this language. Without this specification the EML would remain completely non-normative and open to interpretation.

## Language Units

The concepts represented by the EML are grouped into _language units_. Each language unit describes the tightly coupled modeling concepts that provide EML modelers the capability to represent and describe an aspect of an event driven solution using a particular formalism. For example, the _Domains_ language unit enables a modeler to reason about the jurisdiction and ownership of events, while the _Functions_ language unit considers the behavioural nature of producing and consuming events.
